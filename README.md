# code-server

Run [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) on any machine anywhere and access it through the browser.

- **Code anywhere:** Code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a
  consistent dev environment. Develop on a Linux machine and pick up from any
  device with a web browser.
- **Server-powered:** Take advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.
  Preserve battery life when you're on the go since all intensive tasks runs on your server.
  Make use of a spare computer you have lying around and turn it into a full development environment.

## Getting started

For a proper setup and walkthrough, please see [./doc/guide.md](./doc/guide.md).

### Debian, Ubuntu

```bash
curl -sSOL https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/3.3.0/code-server_3.3.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i code-server_3.3.0_amd64.deb
sudo systemctl --user enable --now code-server
# Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8080. Your password is in ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

### Fedora, Red Hat, SUSE

```bash
curl -sSOL https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/3.3.0/code-server-3.3.0-amd64.rpm
sudo dnf install code-server-3.3.0-amd64.rpm
sudo systemctl --user enable --now code-server
# Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8080. Your password is in ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

### npm

```bash
npm install -g code-server
code-server
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install code-server
brew services start code-server
# Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8080. Your password is in ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
```

### SSH

You can use [sshcode](https://github.com/codercom/sshcode) to start and use code-server on any Linux machine over SSH.

```bash
sshcode user@dev.coder.com
# Downloads and installs code-server on dev.coder.com and opens it in a new browser window.
```

### Digital Ocean

[![Create a Droplet](./doc/assets/droplet.svg)](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/code-server)

### Docker

```bash
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -v "$PWD:/home/coder/project" -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" codercom/code-server:latest
```

This will start a code-server container and expose it at http://127.0.0.1:8080. It will also mount
your current directory into the container as `/home/coder/project` and forward your UID/GID so that
all file system operations occur as your user outside the container.

### Self contained releases

We publish self contained archives for every release on [github](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases).
They bundle the node binary and node_modules.

1. Download the latest release archive for your system from [github](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases)
2. Unpack the release
3. You can run code-server by executing `bin/code-server`

Add the code-server `bin` directory to your `$PATH` to easily execute it without the full path every time.

Here is an example script for installing and using a self-contained code-server release on Linux:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/3.3.0/code-server-3.3.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -C /opt -xz
PATH="$PATH:/opt/code-server-3.3.0-linux-amd64/bin"
code-server
```
